# it includes small apps/bots on python with ML, analytic, NLP, etc

Here I am learning new python libraries or technologies 
You can launch them to explore new technologies/libraries with me 
I will be glad to hear comments and tips on how to make my code better

## Which libraries are used here about ML: 

*if in (), then they will be developed soon*

- ML base: TensorFlow, Keras, scikit-learn, (pytorch)
* NLP: nltk, (transformers)
+ audio data: speechRecogintion, TTS (libroza)
+ data visualisation with ml: matplotlib, plotly (seaborn)
+ financical data: ta, ffn, pandas and numpy, (Crypto Signals, finmarket, yfinance api)
+ image, video data and computer vision science: pillow, imageio, (insigthface, torchvission), tensorflow-graphic, (moviepy, image-match)
+ graph data: igraph,  (networkx)
+ statistics: (PYMC3), tensorflor-rpobality
